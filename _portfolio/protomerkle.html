Merkle trees are a common primitive for blockchain applications, but inside the execution environment they are most commonly used for verification only due to gas and complexity restrictions.
Some projects have implemented append-only merkle trees onchain.

Protomerkle is a solidity library to build and verify merkle trees onchain.
It is general purpose, supports inheritance and is extremely optimized.
A merkle-sum tree implementation is also included, which is very useful for Proof of Reserves.
