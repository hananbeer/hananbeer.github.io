Why?
======

Sqlidity is part of an experiment to merge the world of classic databases and blockchains.

Blockchain is a database but it is hardly used as a classic database. With strange account-storage trees, 32-byte slots and niche languages to access and manipulate them, the friction of using such database as an actual database is very high.

Ideally one key benefit this technological improvement will allow is to easily on-board the 20 million web2 developers such that the transition is seamless, while inheriting web3 properties such as security, accessibility, liveness, integrated finance, etc.
