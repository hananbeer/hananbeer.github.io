A special type of multisig where each signer has a different voting power.

For example, I could deploy a contract with quorum of 10, give myself 10 tokens, give a family member 9 and also give 5 lawyers 1 token each.
In that case I could always sign transactions, a family member will need one of the lawyers to approve but none of the lawyers can collude to sign transactions on their own.
