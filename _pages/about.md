I started hacking games at age 11 - x86 assembly was my first language.
My first target was the classic Icy Tower game using Cheat Engine.
I learned there were so many ways to manipulate the game just by changing bits and bytes in memory, so you could say binary was my first language.

From then I was hooked - as a kid I would reverse engineer and hack any game I played:
Runescape, Gunbound, MapleStory, MU Online, Terraria and more. (MapleStory was my favorite)

Between learning the ins & outs of Cheat Engine to OllyDBG to IDA Pro and everything in between, I continued to learn to code in C & C++ then C# and eventually Python, Javascript and many others.

By the time I started my "professional" career in cyber security I already had experience in hacking windows apps, games, kernel drivers and viruses, when I joined the IDF 8200 unit to do *blank*.

After *blank* I continued my civilian cyber security career at various companies hacking windows, linux, android, user & kernel spaces, web systems, embedded devices from cameras and car systems and even airplanes!

Eventually I became self employed & incorporated my cyber security company, where I continued to provide cyber security services to wide variety of clients: from startups and small companies to fortune 500 companies, from banks and governments to decentralized organizations and hacking smart contracts.

After many years of cyber security I have been enjoying "classic" software engineering: from design, development and optimization, occasionally including reverse engineering, to end-to-end products.

Today I'm focused in the world of AI, researching and developing products with cutting edge models for unique use cases.
